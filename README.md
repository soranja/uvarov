## ✨ About This Project

In 2024, I had a contract with a historical museum in Moscow to build a web experience celebrating the **200th anniversary** of one of their founding figures. The goal was to create an engaging digital biography using modern frontend techniques, animations, and stylized content blocks based on designs provided by the museum’s creative team.

While we successfully delivered the project, it came with a fair share of complications: **miscommunications, sudden changes, unreviewed design tweaks**, and **last-minute requests**. The final product suffered: it was functional, but buggy and unpolished.

Each chapter is presented as a **scroll-driven scene**, where **CSS layering**, **GSAP animations**, and **intersection observers** bring the story to life.

## 🛠️ Why This Refactor

In 2025, I revisited the code and decided to **cherry-pick the juiciest parts**, polish them, and reframe them as a standalone demo that better reflects **my perspective**, **standards**, and **style**.

## 💡 What I Changed

- ✅ **Image Asset Optimization**: reduced sizes heavily where possible;
- ✅ **Animation Refactoring**: modularized animations and scroll logic into clean TypeScript files;
- ✅ **Code Hygiene**: improved structure, naming, responsiveness, and removed legacy/debug code;
- ✅ **Sane Defaults**: styles, breakpoints, and spacing reworked for a smoother, unified look.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **React + Vite**
- **GSAP** (for animation sequences)
- **Intersection Observer API** (for scroll interactions)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind v.3**
